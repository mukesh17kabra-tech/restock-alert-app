# Restock Alert — Shopify App

Notify shoppers by email the moment a specific out-of-stock **variant** comes
back in stock. Built with Next.js (App Router), Prisma, Neon Postgres, and
deployed on Vercel.

## What's included

- `app/api/auth` + `app/api/auth/callback` — Shopify OAuth install flow
- `app/api/webhooks/inventory` — receives `inventory_levels/update` webhooks,
  detects 0 → positive stock changes, emails waiting subscribers
- `app/api/subscribe` — public endpoint the storefront widget calls when a
  shopper signs up for an alert
- `public/widget.js` — drop-in script for product pages
- `app/dashboard` — merchant-facing view of pending/notified signups
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Shop / VariantSubscriber / WebhookLog models

## 1. Create the Neon Postgres database

1. Go to https://console.neon.tech → New Project
2. Copy the **pooled** connection string → `DATABASE_URL`
3. Copy the **direct** connection string → `DIRECT_URL`
   (Neon shows both — direct is required for Prisma migrations to work reliably)

## 2. Create the Shopify app (Partner Dashboard)

1. https://partners.shopify.com → Apps → Create app → "Create app manually"
2. App URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
3. Allowed redirection URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback`
4. Copy the API key/secret into `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` / `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`
5. Required scopes: `read_products,read_inventory,read_locations,read_themes,write_themes`
   (`read_locations` is required alongside `read_inventory` for the
   `inventory_levels/update` webhook to validate. `read_themes`/`write_themes`
   are required for the one-click "auto-install widget" button, which reads
   and edits the merchant's theme files via the Asset API — both scopes are
   needed even though `write_themes` sounds like it should cover reading too.
   Note: registering webhooks via the Admin API doesn't need its own scope —
   there's no such thing as a `write_webhooks` scope, despite how it sounds.)

A `shopify.app.toml` is included in this repo if you'd rather manage the app
via the Shopify CLI (`shopify app dev` / `shopify app deploy`) instead of
clicking through the Partner Dashboard UI. Open it and replace `client_id`
and the URLs with your real app's values — everything in it (scopes,
redirect URL, the inventory webhook) mirrors what's hardcoded in `lib/shopify.ts`
and the `.env` variables, so keep both in sync if you change one.
If you use the CLI, run `shopify app config link` first to connect this
file to your Partner Dashboard app, then `shopify app deploy` to push the
config (webhook subscriptions, scopes, URLs) to Shopify.

## 3. Set environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` locally, and add the same variables in
Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables.

## 4. Install dependencies & generate Prisma client

```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init   # creates tables in Neon
```

## 5. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

Or connect the GitHub repo in the Vercel dashboard for auto-deploys on push.
After the first deploy, update `HOST` in your env vars to the real Vercel URL,
and update the Shopify Partner app's App URL / redirect URL to match.

## 6. Install the app on a test store

Visit:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth?shop=your-test-store.myshopify.com
```
This starts OAuth, stores the access token in Neon, and registers the
inventory webhook automatically.

## 7. Deploy the Theme App Extension (recommended way merchants add the widget)

This repo includes a Theme App Extension at
`extensions/restock-alert-widget/` — a drag-and-drop block merchants add
from the theme editor (Online Store → Themes → Customize → Add block →
Apps → Restock Alert). No code editing required on their end.

Deploy it along with your app config:
```bash
shopify app deploy
```
This is the **only supported way** to have your app write into a
merchant's theme. Shopify's older approach — writing theme files directly
via API (REST Assets or the GraphQL `themeFilesUpsert` mutation) — is
locked behind a manual exemption Shopify grants only to a small set of
theme-customization apps; regular apps get an `ACCESS_DENIED` error even
with `write_themes` granted. Don't build around that API — use a Theme
App Extension instead, as this repo already does.

### Manual snippet (fallback for legacy/vintage themes only)

If a merchant's theme predates Online Store 2.0 and doesn't support app
blocks, they can paste this into a Custom Liquid block on their product
template instead:

```liquid
<div id="restock-alert-widget"
     data-shop="{{ shop.permanent_domain }}"
     data-product-id="{{ product.id }}"
     data-variant-id="{{ product.selected_or_first_available_variant.id }}"
     data-product-title="{{ product.title | escape }}"
     data-variant-title="{{ product.selected_or_first_available_variant.title | escape }}">
</div>
<script src="https://your-app.vercel.app/widget.js" async></script>
```

Show it only when the variant is sold out — wrap it in
`{% unless product.selected_or_first_available_variant.available %} ... {% endunless %}`.

The in-app "Widget setup" tab (`/dashboard/widget-setup`) shows both
options to the merchant directly, recommending the app block first.

## Important note on the inventory webhook

Shopify's `inventory_levels/update` payload gives you an `inventory_item_id`,
not a `variant_id` directly. This starter matches subscribers using
`variantId`, so in production you should either:
- store the `inventory_item_id` as the subscriber's "variantId" at signup time
  (fetch it once via the Admin API when the widget loads), or
- maintain an `inventory_item_id -> variant_id` mapping table synced from
  `products/update` webhooks.

The subscribe/webhook code is structured so this is a small, isolated change.

## Monetization

Plan pricing lives in one place: `lib/billing.ts` → `PLANS`.

| Plan | Price | Signups | WhatsApp/mo | Extra perk | Trial |
|----------|----------|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Free     | $0       | 50 active signups | 0 (email only) | —                          | —     |
| Growth   | $8.99/mo | 200 active signups | 250 | 48h follow-up reminder email | 7 days |
| Pro      | $14.99/mo | Unlimited | 1,000 | 48h follow-up reminder + priority send | 7 days |
| Business | $24.99/mo | Unlimited | 3,000 + overage | Priority send | 7 days |

- The cap is enforced in `app/api/subscribe/route.ts` — once a shop hits its
  plan's signup cap, new signups get a 402 response telling the storefront
  widget to show an "upgrade needed" state.
- `app/api/billing/upgrade?shop=...&plan=growth|pro|business` starts a
  Shopify `recurring_application_charge` for the chosen plan and redirects
  the merchant to Shopify's own hosted approval page (you don't build this
  UI — Shopify shows price, trial, and Accept/Decline).
- `app/api/billing/callback` runs after the merchant approves or declines:
  it activates the charge with Shopify, sets `Shop.plan`, saves the
  `recurringChargeId` (needed for Business-tier overage billing), and
  resets the WhatsApp usage counter.
- The dashboard (`app/dashboard`) shows plan cards with real "Upgrade" links
  for any plan above the shop's current one.
- Set `SHOPIFY_BILLING_TEST_MODE=true` in your env while testing — Shopify
  will simulate the charge without actually billing (required for dev stores).

### Why WhatsApp has a hard cap on every tier except overage on Business

Every WhatsApp template message costs real money (~$0.005/message via
Meta). Unlike storage or signups, letting this scale unbounded with a flat
subscription price means heavier usage costs you more without earning more
— a losing structure as merchants grow. So:
- **Free**: WhatsApp is locked entirely (`whatsappMessageCap: 0`) — email only.
- **Growth/Pro**: hard monthly cap. Once hit, further restock notifications
  for that shop automatically fall back to email (see
  `app/api/webhooks/inventory/route.ts` — `canSendWhatsApp` check) instead
  of failing silently or costing you money beyond what the plan covers.
- **Business**: no hard stop — sends continue past the 3,000/mo included,
  and the overage is billed automatically via Shopify's Usage Charge API
  (`$5` per extra 1,000 messages, rounded up), calculated and charged once
  a month by `app/api/cron/billing-cycle`.
- `Shop.whatsappMessagesThisCycle` / `currentCycleStartedAt` track usage
  per shop; the cron resets these every ~30 days for every shop regardless
  of plan, and only bills overage for Business-tier shops that exceeded
  their cap.

### The 48h reminder (Growth + Pro perk)

A real feature, not just marketing copy: if a shopper gets a restock email
but hasn't ordered within 48 hours and the item is still in stock, they get
one follow-up nudge ("Still available — items from a waitlist restock tend
to sell out again"). This is handled by:

- `VariantSubscriber.reminderSent` — tracks whether the follow-up went out
- `app/api/cron/reminders` — checks for eligible subscribers and sends the
  reminder, gated to `growth`/`pro` shops only
- `vercel.json` — schedules this route to run daily via Vercel Cron
- `CRON_SECRET` env var — protects the route so only Vercel's scheduler
  (or you, manually, with the right header) can trigger it

To change pricing later, edit the `price`/`subscriberCap` values in
`lib/billing.ts` — the dashboard, subscribe route, and billing routes all
read from that single source of truth.

## Next steps to make this production-ready

- Add the `products/update` webhook to keep product/variant titles in sync
- Add uninstall webhook (`app/uninstalled`) to clean up Shop rows and cancel
  any active recurring charge
- Add embedded-app authentication (App Bridge) so `/dashboard` is only
  viewable inside the Shopify Admin iframe, not as a bare public URL
- Handle the case where a Pro merchant's charge is cancelled/frozen by
  Shopify (e.g. failed payment) — listen for the `app_subscriptions/update`
  webhook and downgrade `Shop.plan` back to `"free"`

## WhatsApp setup (as app owner) — do this once

This uses **Twilio** as the WhatsApp provider — Twilio is itself a
Meta-verified WhatsApp Tech Provider, so merchants who install your app
can connect their own WhatsApp number **without creating a Twilio account,
a Meta Business account, or going through Meta's own (often flaky)
verification flow.** Everything happens under your one Twilio account.
The merchant just enters their WhatsApp number in your dashboard, receives
a one-time code by SMS/call on their phone, and enters it back — done.
(Twilio's Senders API doesn't provide a hosted "click this link" signup
page; it's this two-step number + OTP flow instead.)

### 1. Create a Twilio account
1. Go to https://twilio.com → sign up (free trial, no card needed to start)
2. From the Console, copy your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**
   (Console home page, top of the dashboard)

### 2. Set environment variables (Vercel)
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<your Account SID>
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<your Auth Token>
```

### 3. Create and approve the restock alert template
WhatsApp requires every template to be pre-approved once, same as with
direct Meta — Twilio just makes the submission UI simpler.
1. Twilio Console → **Messaging → Content Template Builder** → **Create new**
2. Template name: lowercase + underscores only, e.g. `restock_alert`
3. Category: **Utility**
4. Content type: **Text**
5. Body text (use `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, `{{3}}` placeholders — these map to
   `contentVariables` in `lib/twilio.ts` in order: name, product, link):
   ```
   Hi {{1}}, good news! {{2}} is back in stock. Grab it before it sells out again: {{3}}
   ```
6. Submit for WhatsApp approval (via the same page — Twilio submits to
   Meta on your behalf). Utility templates are usually approved within a
   few hours.
7. Once approved, copy its **Content SID** (starts with `HX...`) into:
   ```
   TWILIO_RESTOCK_TEMPLATE_CONTENT_SID=<the HX... SID>
   ```

### 4. How merchant onboarding works (no setup from you needed per-merchant)
1. Merchant enters their WhatsApp number in your app's dashboard
   (`/dashboard/whatsapp`) and submits
2. Your app calls `createWhatsAppSender()` (`lib/twilio.ts`), which
   registers a new Sender under **your** Twilio account for that number —
   this triggers Twilio to send a one-time verification code to the
   merchant's phone via SMS (or voice call)
3. The merchant reads that code off their phone and enters it into a
   second field in your dashboard
4. Your app calls `verifyWhatsAppSender()` with that code, completing
   verification — Twilio moves the sender's status toward `ONLINE`
5. Twilio also POSTs status updates to `/api/whatsapp/status-webhook` as
   the sender's status changes; your app keeps that shop's
   `whatsappSenderStatus` in sync and records `whatsappConnectedAt` once
   it reaches `ONLINE`
6. From then on, restock alerts for that shop send via
   `sendWhatsAppViaTwilio()` using that shop's own number as the `From`

Every shop's `twilioSenderSid` / `whatsappNumber` / `whatsappSenderStatus`
lives in its own `Shop` row — fully multi-tenant under your single Twilio
account.

### 5. Test end-to-end
1. Deploy with `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and
   `TWILIO_RESTOCK_TEMPLATE_CONTENT_SID` set
2. Go to `/dashboard/whatsapp?shop=your-dev-store.myshopify.com`
3. Click **Connect WhatsApp**, complete the Twilio-hosted flow with a real
   phone number you control
4. Set **Notification channels** to "WhatsApp only" or "Email + WhatsApp"
5. Sign up for a restock alert on a sold-out product using that phone
   number, then mark the variant back in stock in Shopify Admin — you
   should receive the WhatsApp message

### Costs (via Twilio, India, Utility category)
- Twilio's fee: **$0.005/message**, flat
- Meta's fee (passed through by Twilio): **~$0.0034/message** outside a
  customer service window, **free** if the customer messaged you first in
  the last 24h
- Total: roughly **$0.0084/message (~₹0.70)** in the worst case
- Check current rates any time at https://www.twilio.com/en-us/whatsapp/pricing
  (has a live calculator by country/category)
- No separate per-number monthly rental was found on Twilio's WhatsApp
  pricing page as of this writing — confirm current Sender-related fees
  in your own Twilio Console before relying on this for margin planning
